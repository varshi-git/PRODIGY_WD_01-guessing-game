# PRODIGY_WD_01-guessing-game
A simple console-based game where the player guesses a randomly generated number . The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct and tracks the number of attempts. This project helps practice Java concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input.
